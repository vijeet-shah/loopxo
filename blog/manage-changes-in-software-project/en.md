## First Rule: Avoid Too Many Changes at Once

The fastest way to mess up a project?

Try changing **everything** at once.

Here’s what usually happens:

- **Team gets confused**: Nobody knows what’s important anymore.
- **Work slows down**: People need extra time to catch up or learn new things.
- **Bugs creep in**: Because changes weren’t properly tested.
- **Team morale tanks**: Overwhelm and frustration take over.

**My simple rule:** Too much change = Chaos. And chaos **kills projects**. Only introduce big changes when absolutely necessary — otherwise, stay focused.

## Why Tiny Changes Beat Giant Leaps?

Quick question for you: Have you ever noticed how most **new restaurants** don't invent an entirely new cuisine?

They usually:

- Stick to a proven model (like burgers or pizza or chinese)
- Add a **small twist** (maybe exotic toppings or fusion flavors)

This way:

- They **reduce risk** — people already like the basic idea.
- They **move faster** — no need to reinvent every part of the business.

The same thinking applies to projects. **Copy what's proven. Innovate slowly.**

## The Hidden Cost of Every Change

Every change seems exciting at first. But each one comes with a hidden price:

- New code → **Technical debt** (you’ll have to clean it up later)
- New features → **More bugs** and **more testing**
- New design → **Slower adoption** from users and devs

Here’s the hard truth:

You can either move fast, or you can change everything — **but not both.**

## Change Stacking: The Smarter Way to Evolve

Instead of dropping five changes on your team at once, do it **one by one**.

- Make a single change.
- Release it.
- Watch the results.
- THEN move to the next thing.

**Pro Tip**:

If you’re adding a feature *and* redesigning the UI — **split it into two releases**.

Get the backend stable first, then roll out the new look.

## A Simple System to Handle Changes Better

| Step | What It Means | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facilitate Easy Change | Build stable foundations first. | Get CI/CD pipelines running before big releases. |
| Visualize the End Goal | Be super clear about where you're going. | Sketch out final workflows before coding. |
| Implement Incrementally | Stack changes slowly, one at a time. | Launch login feature first, then dashboard, then settings. |

**Key Insight**:

One clear goal. One solid step at a time. That’s how you keep your team moving without burning them out.

## Final Thought

If you remember just one thing:

**Too much change at once = disaster.
Small, controlled steps = real success.**

Make "slow stacking" your team's habit, and you'll:

- Ship faster 🚀
- Break fewer things 🛠️
- Keep everyone energized 😎
